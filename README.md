Home Sales Data Analysis with SparkSQL
Overview
In this challenge, you'll utilize SparkSQL to analyze home sales data by calculating key metrics, creating temporary views, partitioning data, caching and uncaching tables, and verifying the uncaching process.

Technologies Used
Apache Spark (PySpark)

SparkSQL

Steps to Complete the Challenge
1. Load the Home Sales Data
Read the dataset into a Spark DataFrame from a CSV or other structured format.

Inspect the data schema to understand its structure.

2. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Display the first few rows of the dataset.

Identify key features (e.g., sale price, location, date, size).

Check for missing or inconsistent data.

3. Use SparkSQL to Analyze Key Metrics
Register the DataFrame as a temporary SQL view.

Write and execute SQL queries to determine important home sale metrics, such as:

Average home sale price

Median sale price

Total number of homes sold

Yearly trends in home sales

4. Partitioning the Data
Partition the dataset based on a relevant column (e.g., year or location).

Observe how partitioning impacts performance.

5. Caching and Uncaching Tables
Cache a temporary table to optimize performance.

Run queries before and after caching to measure execution time improvements.

Uncache the table and verify that it has been removed from memory.

6. Verify Uncaching
Check Sparkâ€™s storage information to confirm that the table is no longer cached.

Expected Outputs
A summary report of key home sales statistics.

Insights into performance improvements due to partitioning and caching.

Confirmation of successful uncaching of the temporary table.

How to Run the Project
Install and configure Apache Spark (or use a Databricks environment).

Load the dataset into a Spark DataFrame.

Execute the provided SparkSQL queries and transformations.

Analyze results and performance improvements.

Conclusion
By completing this challenge, you will gain hands-on experience with SparkSQL and its optimization techniques, including caching, partitioning, and temporary views.
